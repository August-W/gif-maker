This simple project uses chrriis.dj.nativeswing.swtimpl.NativeInterface. 
Each tab is simply "web browsing" an embedded youtube live stream. Unfortunately, not a lot of news
channels live stream to youtube and I am unable to embed their live stream videos. There are only
a few channels here, but it is easy to add more. All the tabs connect to their embed links at
once.
