This project uses some code written by Elliot Kroo and Zeheng Li. 
The GIFs produced here are saved in a "gifmaker" folder here:  C://Users/Public/gifmaker
The screenshots used in the GIF are saved in that folder as well.

~~~~~Currently, there isn't a way to set the time length frames in the GIF. I should be able to set it so
that the GIF lasts as long as the time the screen was recorded.
